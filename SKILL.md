# Browser Workspace

Browser Workspace is the **only browser skill agents should load**. It includes the browser-control runtime, workspace/tab leasing, persistent Python sessions, snapshot refs, and site-specific platform workflows. Do not load or invoke a separate `browser-harness` or `browser-platforms` skill.

## Agent contract

Install the Skill instructions through your preferred skill manager, but run the published Python CLI through **PyPI/uvx**. The Skill directory is documentation, not the executable source of truth:

```bash
bw() { uvx browser-workspace "$@"; }
bw status
```

On first use, `uvx` installs Browser Workspace and Python dependencies from PyPI into its managed cache. No local source checkout, `.venv`, `.env`, or `npx` CLI is required. Use `uvx browser-workspace ...` consistently, including in NeoY/Agents Relay workers.

Use one session-owned execution path for orchestrated browser work:

```text
start one Browser Workspace session
  -> retain SESSION_ID for the whole workflow
  -> platform run <platform> <action> --session-id SESSION_ID
  -> inspect each result
  -> on recoverable failure, diagnose and self-heal in the SAME session
  -> write every successful site-specific repair back to the platform code
  -> continue until the external workflow reaches a terminal outcome
  -> verify the terminal external state
finally
  -> stop SESSION_ID
```

`platform run` therefore requires `--session-id` by default. If omitted, the CLI returns a structured error that recommends the `session start -> platform run --session-id -> self-heal -> session stop` workflow. `--auto-session` is an explicit one-shot escape hatch: it creates and cleans up a temporary session automatically, but **does not provide orchestrator self-heal** after failure.

There are no separate top-level `open`, `tabs`, `status`, or `screenshot` commands.

Every logical browser workflow must follow:

```text
start
  -> exec
  -> exec
  -> ...
finally
  -> stop
```

Rules:

- Start one session per logical browser workflow and retain its `session_id`.
- Reuse that same session for every action/observation turn.
- Always stop the session in cleanup/finally, including on failure or cancellation.
- A session owns one leased browser tab and a persistent Python namespace.
- Multiple independent workflows may use different sessions concurrently.

## Start

Default workspace is `Harness`:

```bash
bw session start
```

Normal agents do not choose or manage workspaces. `session start` defaults to `Harness`; the `--workspace` implementation option is hidden from normal CLI help. Workspace lifecycle is not exposed through the agent CLI. Product runtimes that need persistent isolation discover the product-only Node admin helper with `browser-workspace status`, then call `ensureWorkspace` / `deleteWorkspace` through that helper.

Start directly at a URL when known:

```bash
bw session start --url https://example.com
```

The result is JSON containing `session_id`, `workspace`, `target_id`, the starting `url`, and `workspace_supported`.

Browser Workspace self-manages exactly one machine-wide persistent, visible Chrome instance. Every session and runtime must reuse that singleton. Runtime/config overrides must never create another Chrome. Browser Workspace owns the user-data directory and local CDP endpoint, prefers port 9222, and selects another candidate only when starting the singleton for the first time. Agents do not choose a Chrome profile or enable remote debugging. The Chrome workspace extension remains optional: Chrome Stable blocks silent local unpacked-extension loading, so sessions continue in plain-browser mode when the extension is absent; grouping/lease isolation becomes available when the extension is installed.

## Exec

`session exec` reads Python from stdin. Helpers are already imported; do not import another browser package.

```bash
bw session exec <session_id> <<'PY'
print(page_info())
print(snapshot())
PY
```

Python state persists across later calls in the same session:

```bash
bw session exec <session_id> <<'PY'
meeting_name = "Demo"
print(current_tab())
PY
```

Then later:

```bash
bw session exec <session_id> <<'PY'
print(meeting_name)
PY
```

A Python file may also be used with `--code-file`.

## Stop

```bash
bw session stop <session_id>
```

Stopping closes every tab owned or opened by that session—including tabs created with `new_tab()`, `bh.new_tab()`, and detected child/popup tabs—then destroys the session's Python namespace. Raw `cdp("Target.createTarget", ...)` is rejected; use `new_tab()` so Browser Workspace can own and group the tab. It does not close unrelated browser tabs. Do not reuse the ID afterward.

A safe shell structure is:

```bash
SESSION_JSON=$(bw session start)
SESSION_ID=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.loads(sys.argv[1])["session_id"])' "$SESSION_JSON")
trap 'bw session stop "$SESSION_ID" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true' EXIT

bw session exec "$SESSION_ID" <<'PY'
print(snapshot())
PY
```

## Browser helpers

The session exposes the browser primitives directly, including:

```python
page_info()
goto_url(url)
current_tab()
new_tab(url)
close_tab(...)
js(expression, target_id=None)
cdp(method, ...)
wait_for_load()
wait_for_element(...)
fill_input(selector, text)
click(selector)
capture_screenshot(...)
```

Use the higher-level helpers first. Use raw `js(...)`/`cdp(...)` only when needed.

Interaction-specific reference material is bundled under `interaction-skills/` inside this skill.

## Snapshot refs

`snapshot()` returns a compact accessibility-oriented view and writes each returned ref directly onto the corresponding live DOM element as `data-ref="eN"`.

Example:

```text
- button "Calendar" [ref=e1]
- button "Meet now" [ref=e2]
- textbox "Meeting name" [ref=e3]
```

The live DOM then contains equivalent annotations such as:

```html
<button data-ref="e2">Meet now</button>
```

Refs are ordinary CSS selectors. Use normal helpers:

```python
print(snapshot())
click('[data-ref="e2"]')
fill_input('[data-ref="e3"]', 'Demo meeting')
```

Do **not** invent `click("e2")`, `click_ref("e2")`, or an `@e2` API. After navigation or a substantial DOM update, call `snapshot()` again and use the new refs.

`snapshot(interactive_only=False)` may include named content roles in addition to interactive elements. `target_id=` may be used for target-specific inspection.

## Workspaces

Default configuration:

```text
BH_WORKSPACE_NAME=Harness
BH_WORKSPACE_POOL_SIZE=5
```

When the Browser Workspace Chrome extension is installed, the pool size is the maximum concurrent capacity; tabs are created lazily. The extension owns grouping, lease/release, idle reclaim, and workspace isolation.

Without the extension, browser sessions still work using the built-in browser core. Workspace names, grouping, pool capacity, lease isolation, and idle reclaim are unavailable; tab/navigation/input/snapshot/platform helpers continue to work. `workspace_status()` reports `supported: false` instead of failing.

Available workspace helpers include:

```python
workspace_create("Research", 5)
workspace_status()
workspace_list()
workspace_resize("Research", 6)
workspace_delete("Research")
```

Never use URL as tab identity. Workspace ownership and leased target identity are authoritative.

## Platform contract

Known-site knowledge is bundled under `platforms/`. A platform contains **site/domain behavior only**.

```text
platforms/<name>/
├── README.md       site behavior and rules
├── manifest.yaml   actions + verification metadata
├── actions/        reusable browser action code
└── flows/          optional flow documentation
```

Platform rules:

- Platform actions may use semantic browser helpers such as `new_tab()`, `current_tab()`, `snapshot()`, `click(selector)`, `fill_input(selector, text)`, `js()`, `cdp()`, uploads, downloads, and screenshots. `cdp()` must not create targets; `Target.createTarget` is blocked and tab creation must use `new_tab()`.
- Platform interaction code must be **semantic and element-based**. It must not use screen coordinates, viewport coordinates, `x/y` click targets, `click_at_xy()`, or coordinate calculations to interact with the page. Browser size, zoom, display resolution, and viewport geometry must not affect correctness.
- Platform actions must **not** create/stop Browser Workspace sessions, choose a workspace, call workspace-management APIs, invoke the Browser Workspace CLI, or import session/workspace infrastructure.
- The orchestrator owns the session lifecycle for normal platform execution: start once, retain the same session across execution and recovery, and stop only after terminal success, terminal failure, or an explicit human blocker.
- On any recoverable failure, the orchestrator must inspect the live page in the same session, diagnose the failure, repair/recover, and resume from the safest point rather than restarting the whole workflow.
- **Self-heal writeback is mandatory:** if recovery discovers a site-specific selector, flow, wait condition, validation rule, or other adapter fix that makes the action work, write that repair back to `platforms/<name>/actions/` (and update platform docs/verification metadata when applicable) before declaring the workflow complete. A repair that exists only in an ad-hoc session snippet is not complete.
- After a possible external side effect (publish, send, payment, delete, submit, etc.), recovery must be verification-first. Never repeat the side effect until read-only evidence proves the previous attempt did not take effect.
- Platform `README.md` and flow docs should describe site behavior, preconditions, side effects, and verification evidence—not Browser Workspace lifecycle mechanics.
- Do not rediscover a known site's mechanics when a verified platform flow/action already exists.

Normal orchestrator workflow:

```bash
SESSION_JSON=$(bw session start --url https://example.com)
SESSION_ID=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.loads(sys.argv[1])["session_id"])' "$SESSION_JSON")

bw platform run microsoft-teams meeting \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --config /path/to/config.json

# If it fails: inspect/self-heal using the same SESSION_ID, write the repair
# back to the platform implementation, then resume safely.

bw session stop "$SESSION_ID"
```

One-shot mode is explicit and is not self-healing:

```bash
bw platform run microsoft-teams meeting \
  --auto-session \
  --config /path/to/config.json
```

Use `--auto-session` only when losing the browser state after a failure is acceptable.

### Platform verification contract

Every `platforms/<name>/manifest.yaml` must declare:

Platform-owned publishing facts belong in the same manifest, not in caller-specific tables. When applicable, declare `media`, `fields`, `capabilities`, `content_mapping`, and platform notes there. Callers inspect them with `browser-workspace platform profile <name>` and must not maintain a second authoritative limits/capabilities registry.

```text
platform:
status:
last_verified:
actions:
verification:
  status:
  last_verified:
  evidence:
```

Verification rules:

- `verified`: exercised against the live site and supported by concrete evidence.
- `partially_verified`: some declared flows are live-verified while others remain implemented but unverified.
- `migrated_unverified`: code was migrated from a previously working adapter but has not yet been live-verified in the current Browser Workspace integration.
- Never upgrade a status merely because code compiles or contract tests pass.
- Flow-level verification in `manifest.yaml` should be more specific than the platform-wide status.
- When live behavior changes, update `last_verified`, evidence, and affected flow status in the same change.

Current bundled platforms:

```text
platforms/chatgpt/
platforms/chrome-web-store/
platforms/microsoft-teams/
platforms/tiktok/
platforms/wechat-channels/
platforms/xhs/
platforms/youtube/
```

Read the matching platform `README.md` and `manifest.yaml` before invoking or modifying a known flow. The platform README is documentation owned by this root Browser Workspace skill; it is not a separately loadable skill.

## Installation

Use the published PyPI command (requires `uv`/`uvx`):

```bash
uvx browser-workspace status
uvx browser-workspace session list
```

`uvx` resolves the published Python wheel and installs the dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`. Do not run the legacy bundled installer or point agents at a checked-out `bin/browser-workspace` script. The installed CLI reuses the same Browser Workspace Chrome profile and Session Daemon socket.

There is no required separate Browser Harness installation.

The Chrome extension is recommended but not required. Without it Browser Workspace runs in plain-browser mode and `session start` provides the installation link. The public Web Store URL is:

```text
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kgbghhigmbpefppgkocgjgnnnbhjchic
```

The extension is also bundled at `extension/` for unpacked/development installs. Default extension ID:

```text
kgbghhigmbpefppgkocgjgnnnbhjchic
```

## Internal provenance

The low-level browser runtime is forked from `browser-use/browser-harness` and kept internally under `src/browser_harness/`. Browser Workspace is the public product/skill/CLI surface. Upstream licensing is preserved under `licenses/`.
